## Prompt library for AI-assisted academic writing with ethical guidance

**[➡️ Access the CARefully prompt library here](https://olivethree.github.io/carefullyprompt/)**


CARefully prompt your AI is an interactive library of carefully designed prompts that help academics, researchers, and educators use AI writing tools more effectively and ethically. With prompts organized by writing goals and categorized according to ethical considerations, this tool helps you maintain control and integrity in your academic writing process.

## What is the CARefully prompt library?

This resource contains a collection of effective prompt templates for various writing tasks, designed to help you interact with AI writing assistants more effectively and ethically. Each prompt in the library is categorized based on common writing goals and includes clear ethical guidance based on the framework proposed by Cheng et al. (2025).

Simply browse categories, select a specific task, and copy the prompt template that fits your needs. Replace the placeholder text with your own content before using with your preferred AI assistant.

## Features

- **Ethically-informed prompts**: All prompts are categorized according to a tier system based on established research
- **Comprehensive categories**: From improving existing text to drafting assistance to maintaining your unique voice
- **Copy-to-clipboard functionality**: Easy one-click copying of prompts
- **Clear instructions**: Each prompt includes guidance on how to evaluate AI outputs
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark mode support**: Comfortable viewing in any lighting conditions

## The CARe Framework

The library is organized according to the CARe framework (Oliveira, 2025), with a focus on the Articulate stage:

### C: Collect (Gather Ideas & Strategic Evaluation)
- **What it is:** Working with AI to gather and organize ideas, sources, and key points to lay a strong foundation for your writing.
- **Your Role:** You guide the AI to find relevant content and structure it logically, carefully evaluating suggestions to ensure accuracy, relevance, and fairness.

### A: Articulate (Drafting & Generating Text + Critical Mid-Stage Evaluation)
- **What it is:** Using AI tools with specific prompts to help articulate your ideas, draft sentences or paragraphs, rephrase text, or get scaffolding for sections.
- **Your Role:** You continuously evaluate every piece of text the AI generates for accuracy, tone, clarity, relevance, and immediate red flags. You begin the iterative refinement process based on this evaluation.

### R: Refine (Comprehensive Review, Verification & Final Polishing)
- **What it is:** The critical final phase where you ensure academic rigor, integrity, and the final quality of the writing. This involves rigorous verification, bias detection, ensuring integrity, maintaining your authorial voice, and final polishing.
- **Your Role:** You are in full control, making all final decisions. You rigorously verify AI claims against original sources. You actively shape the text to reflect your voice and analysis.

### e: evaluate strategically & ethically
- **What it is:** This lowercase 'e' is a constant reminder that critical evaluation is a continuous, strategic, and ethical mindset applied throughout the entire process.
- **Your Role:** You pause and evaluate strategically (Is this helping? What's next?) and ethically (Bias? Transparency? Integrity?) at every point you interact with AI output. You are the responsible author.

## Ethical Tier System

The library uses a three-tier ethical framework from Cheng et al. (2025):

- **Tier 1: Ethically Acceptable** - Tasks like grammar checking, spelling correction, readability improvements, and basic language translation of existing text.
- **Tier 2: Ethically Contingent** - Tasks like generating drafts based on significant user input, summarizing user-provided content, improving clarity, brainstorming ideas, rephrasing, or adjusting tone. These tasks require careful human oversight.
- **Tier 3: Ethically Suspect/Not Recommended** - Tasks involving drafting entirely new text with minimal user input or developing entirely new concepts.

## How to Use the Library

1. Browse the main categories (Improve Existing Text, Drafting Assistance, Maintain Voice & Precision)
2. Select a specific task from the subcategories
3. Review the available prompt templates, paying attention to their ethical tier classification
4. Click the copy button on your chosen prompt
5. Paste the prompt into your preferred AI assistant
6. Replace the placeholder text (e.g., [Your text here]) with your own content
7. Critically evaluate and refine the AI-generated output
